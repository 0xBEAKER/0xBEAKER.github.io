permalink: '/publication/Mailloux-Beach-Span-2018-Examination-of-Security-Design-Principles-from-NIST-SP-800-160'
excerpt: 'This paper explores the engineering of secure and resilient systems through a detailed examination of security strategies and principles as presented in Appendix F of the recently published National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-160. First, a brief introduction to systems security engineering is provided with recommended readings for those who desire to become more familiar with the specialty domain. Next, the NIST SP 800-160 Appendix F systems security strategies and principles are described, as well as, examined for implementation considerations. This examination and mapping provides a linkage of abstract security strategies to concrete security principles which can be more directly implemented, traced, and tested.'

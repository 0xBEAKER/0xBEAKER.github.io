title: "A STAMP-Based Approach to Developing Quantifiable Measures of Resilience"
collection: publications
permalink: '/publication/paper2'
excerpt: 'The quality of resilience is a desirable attribute in today's complex cyber-physical systems, but there is little consensus on what constitutes a suitable metric for resiliency. This work seeks to build upon an existing method for developing suitable resiliency metrics for complex cyber-physical systems. Specifically, several definitions of resilience are presented and their applicability to quantifiable measures of resilience is discussed. Next, methods for identifying and evaluating the impact of disruptive events on a system of interest and the development of resilience strategies is discussed. Finally, a detailed case study demonstrating a systems-based approach for the development and analysis of quantifiable measures of resiliency is presented.'

title: "Developing a Methodology for the Identification of Alternative NoSQL Data Models via Observation of Relational Database Usage"
collection: publications
permalink: '/publication/paper4'
excerpt: 'NoSQL databases are largely synonymous with Big Data applications, however there is existing research to support their usage for smaller scale applications (even on a single desktop). This work seeks to reinforce this notion by proposing a methodology to identify when a NoSQL database may be better suited than an existing Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). First, approaches to characterizing database workloads are discussed, along with a summary of relevant benchmarking metrics. Then, we present a methodology for evaluating the suitability of an existing RDBMS against possible alternative NoSQL databases.'
